### Associated with Big Data

* Social Networking
* Data Analytics
* Sampling
  * Revamping and changing in statistics
  * With all of the information you can give exact answers
  * Machine learning at a lower level
* Storage
  * NoSQL not great for arbitrary queries after the fact. Easy to add and remove structures (schemes). 
  * SQL is great for answering queries that you've optimized using table structures (schemes), but can also work for un-optomized queries. 
  * Data Modeling is hard
   * Data in the wrong model is hard to reformat and use
* Data Collection & Cleaning
  * Store in raw from then perform batch jobs
  * Store data using certain model
* InfoViz
  * D3
   * JavaScript that  will help you vizualize data in a browser

### Data Lifecycle

1. Question?
  * Curation "Which data sets should be collected"
  * Triage "Priortization of the data sets"
  * Persistance "How long the data will be around"
2. Collection
  * Generation
3. CleanUp
4. Storage
5. Processing/Analysis
6. Query
  * Vizualize 
  * Act

***
### Most common interaction with big data

* HTTP request  for a html page
  * Request Response Cycle
